<h2>Git & GitHub - introduction and relation</h2>

<h3>What is a Distributed Version Control System?</h3>
<p>A <b>Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)</b> or </b>Version Control System (VCS)</b> is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so you can recall specific versions of these files at any point later.</p>

<h3>Why is it so important to use DVCS in development?</h3>

+ <b>Having different versions of the same file gives you massive power over your code.</b> As said before, if you break something in the latest version of the code, you will be able to recover the old correct version of your code.
+ It is also beneficial when you <b>combine code made by multiple developers into one file</b>, or even different files into one project. When merging the changes made on the same file but by different developers, you can face multiple conflicts between these changes. (Don’t worry if you don’t understand this right now, you are going to learn this in-depth later on.)
+ Another cool feature that it provides you is the chance to see <b>who is the owner of each piece of code.</b> It allows you to defend how many hours have you been working, of course, but it is funnier to use it to figure out who has messed up the code. :bomb:


<h3>What is Git?</h3>
<p><b>Git is a free and open DVCS </b>designed to handle computer programming projects with speed and efficiency. It is easy to learn and has a very high performance.</p>
<p><b>Git runs locally.</b> What does it mean? It allows you to use the Version Control System on your laptop. It means that you will have <b>in your computer</b> a Version Control System, to recover all code, see what changes you have done, etc.</p>

<h3>What is GitHub?</h3>
<p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for revision control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.</p>

<p>With GitHub, you can do a bunch of things when collaborating on a project:</p>

+ control different versions of the code,
+ create different branches,
+ fork repositories,
+ do pull requests,
+ see other’s people projects (and learn how they code),
+ comment on other’s people code.

<h3>How are Git and GitHub related?</h3>
<p>:star2::star2::star2: <b>Git</b> allows you to control your code in your local machine, while <b>GitHub</b> will enable you to <b>collaborate</b> with your teammates by pushing and pulling the code you and the others have been working on.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

+ <b>push</b> meaning making the code that was made locally, on your laptop, available online (on GitHub) so the others can use it;
+ <b>pull</b> meaning taking the code from online platform (GitHub) to your laptop so you can re-use it and add/remove things from it.
