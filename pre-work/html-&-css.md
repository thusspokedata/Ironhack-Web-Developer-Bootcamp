<h2>Introduction to the frontend</h3>

<p><b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b> is a group of technologies and languages that compose the frontend of your web applications.</p>
<p>The term <b>frontend</b> is reserved for all the parts of your app that users can see and interact with.</p>
<p>The main <em>difference between frontend and the backend</em> is that the <b>frontend</b> is mainly visual parts, and users can interact with them, while <b>backend</b> is where all the logic (functionality) of the app is and is not visible to users.</p>

<h3>The Bones: HTML</h3>
<p><b>HTML</b> is the bones that give your web page structure. It consists of tags or elements on your page that describe what the content is.</p>

<h3>The Skin/Hair/Clothing: CSS</h3>
<p>Your skin and hair, along with your clothing and other external belongings define how you look. Most people have a similar-looking skeleton, but we all look unique because of these specific and individual factors.</p>
<p><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b> is used to style your page, and give it that unique touch. In simple English: CSS is what <b>gives a nice presentation of the page.</b></p>

<h3>The Muscles: JavaScript</h3>

<p>Your body has structure, it has a unique appearance, but of equal importance is your ability to perform tasks and do things such as run, jump, dance, etc. Your muscles give you this ability.</p>
<p>You can build and style a very nice webpage just using HTML and CSS, but if you want to add some user interaction, you have to start thinking in the direction of using JavaScript on your page. The simplest form of user interaction are <b>events</b> - a user clicks on some button or link, and part of the page changes as a consequence of that click (the most simplified way to explain this).</p>
